- Architecture
    - ...

- Build
    - Make a production build
    - Try to enable precompiled header (core/pch.h)

- Core
    - Make engine's user pointer and sandbox thread safety

- Tools
    - ...

- Window
    - Switch to DPI stuff for monitor and window adjustment?

- Math
    - Clean up vec.h
    - Adapt m4 for AVX-512

- Graphics
    - Custom graphics shaders' parser and GraphicsProgram generation // I'm going to break everything and it gonna be awesome :)
        - Shaders' includes
        - Root Signature stuff
        - Stream output
    - Custom compute shader's parser and ComputeProgram generation   // Continue breaking everything
    - Custom blenging (I have no idea how to implement it)
    - User-side GPU command lists and bundles
    - Support triangle strips (define topology in shaders?)
    - Support stream output (in shaders too?)
    - Textures
    - Entity system
    - Particle system

- Sound
    - Create a common audio session for entire program
    - Allow to create more audio streams
    - Different callbacks for audios and sounds (fx)
