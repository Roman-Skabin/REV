- Core
    - Make engine's user pointer and sandbox thread safety
    - Improve timer: public, name, segmented profiling, output result to... somewhere
    - MORE SIGNIFICANT LOGS. HAVE TO BE ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

- Tools
    - gpu/core/interns to the tools?

- Build
    - [Pre?]build system. Build only edited files
      (source file change time > .obj file change time)

- Window
    - Switch to DPI stuff for monitor and window adjustment?

- Math
    - Adapt to different ISA vec.h and mat.h

- GPU
    - FIX GPU RESOURCES!!! PRIMIRY TASK.
    - TODOs in cengine/gpu/gpu_memory_manager.h
    - Clean up GPUMemoryManager and GPUProgramManager
    - Print D3D12/DXGI messages in separate "while true" thread
    - Do ResizeGPUBuffers when we choose another screen dimension
    - Custom compute shader's parser and ComputeProgram generation
    - User-side GPU command lists and bundles?
    - Several adapters support

- Graphics
    - Custom graphics shader's parser and GraphicsProgram generation
        - SRVs, UAVs, static samplers, tables (, constants?)
        - Add Root Signature v1.1 specific settings.
        - Includes
        - Parse templates (Buffer<type> name; vector<type, dim> name; ...)
        - Stream output
    - Save shaders bytecode in some files and compile only shaders that
      source file change time > bytecode file change time?
    - Switch from 1 to 3 Render Targets for OIT
    - Weighted Blended OIT
    - Support triangle strips (define topology in shaders?)
    - Support stream output (define it in shaders too?)
    - Textures
    - SubTextures
    - Entity system
    - Particle system
    - TextRenderer (DirectWrite + D2D)

- Sound
    - Create a common audio session for entire program
    - Allow to create more audio streams
    - Different callbacks for audios and sounds (fx)

- Editor
    - GUI (ImGUI or write my own?)
