- Core
    - Make engine's user pointer and sandbox thread safety
    - Improve timer: public, name, segmented profiling, output result to... somewhere
    - MORE SIGNIFICANT LOGS. HAVE TO BE ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

- Tools
    - gpu/core/interns to the tools?

- Window
    - Switch to DPI stuff for monitor and window adjustment?

- Math
    - Adapt to different ISA vec.h and mat.h

- GPU
    - Clean up GPUMemoryManager stuff
    - WaitForGPU, FlushGPU and EndFrame in several work threads
    - Init DebugQueue and DebugList. Add InfoQueue
    - Do ResizeGPUBuffers when we choose another screen dimension
    - Copmlete memory managment via GPUMemoryManager
        - free list for descriptors
        - free list for resources?
    - Custom compute shader's parser and ComputeProgram generation
    - User-side GPU command lists and bundles
    - Several adapters support

- Graphics
    - Switch from 1 to 3 Render Targets (OIT needs 2 additional).
    - Custom graphics shader's parser and GraphicsProgram generation
        - Root Signature stuff: SRVs, UAVs, static samplers, tables
        - Includes
        - Parse templates (Buffer<type> name; vector<type, dim> name; ...)
        - Stream output
    - Weighted Blended OIT
    - Support triangle strips (define topology in shaders?)
    - Support stream output (define it in shaders too?)
    - Textures
    - SubTextures
    - Entity system
    - Particle system
    - TextRenderer (DirectWrite + D2D)

- Sound
    - Create a common audio session for entire program
    - Allow to create more audio streams
    - Different callbacks for audios and sounds (fx)
