- Core
    - Complete core\platform.h
    - Move all STD includes from platform.h to pch.h?
    - Scene serialization
    - ISA wide CopyMemory, MoveMemory, ZeroMemory, CompareMemory // @Optimization
    - Single namespace for everything? (get rid of Math and GPU namespaces)
    - Minimize number of system calls // @Optimization
    - Vertex buffer/index files (some custom formats for various types of meshes)?
    - Stack trace in PrintDebugMessage on error.

- Settings
    - Logs folder, ini folder
    - Max view distance (max LOD & far)

- Tools
    - Wait for multiple events
    - Change a bit StringBuidler (example: StaticStringBuilder)
    - Create StaticString and StaticStringBuilder on arenas
    - Replace std::function in REV::Function
    - Hash table
    - UTF-8 strings?

- Git
    - Custom commit/push scripts with tags checks like Jon's nocheckin
