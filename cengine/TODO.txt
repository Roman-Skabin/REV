- Window
    - Switch to DPI stuff for monitor and window adjustment ?

- Math
    - CPU optimizations
    - Other orthos & persps

    - Multi-threaded rendering
    - Cache for rasterizer
    - Batch rendering ?
    - Texture/Image
    - Entity system
    - Particle system
    - Hardware acceleration (D3D12)

- Sound
    - Deal with no sound
    - Check if samples are f32 or u32
    - Pass some wave format stuff to the AudioCallback and remove it from the Engine State
